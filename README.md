# FlagGuesserGame
flag guessing game, a leaderboard system is what i am working on next

notes

i tried adding function to allow the user to press enter, rather than pressing the guess button. i tried to do this using 'keydown' but it would loop through the code and produce multiple instances of the enter key, could not fix but working on it
