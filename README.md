# FlagGuesserGame
a frontend web app that plays a flag guessing game, i am currently working on implementing a back end and leaderboard system. possible bugs but none i am aware of

in order for the program to work you will have to create a folder in the same directory as the index document called 'flags' and fill the folder up with photos of countries flags. name the picture in the format "001CountryName" where the number increments with every picture. The code is written in a way where you can have a custom amount of flags by changing the 'getRandomInt' function to the amount of flags you have
