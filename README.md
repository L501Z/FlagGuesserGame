# FlagGuesserGame
a frontend web app that plays a flag guessing game, i am currently working on implementing a back end and leaderboard system. probably a lot of bugs

in order for the program to work you will have to create a folder in the same directory as the index document called 'flags' and fill the folder up with photos of countries flags. name the picture in the format "001CountryName" where the number increments with every picture. The code is written in a way where you can have a custom amount of flags by changing the 'getRandomInt' function to the amount of flags you have

i tried adding a keypress function to allow the user to press enter rather than pressing the guess button. i tried to do this using 'keydown' but it would loop through the code and produce multiple instances of the enter key, could not fix but working on it
